Every life cycle hook logs the following statement on the console:
	'<life_cycle_hook_name> called'

First of all, the constructor of the component gets called. After that, starting from ngOnInit, all the lifecycle hooks are called in sequence as defined in the previous text file. 

ngOnChanges is called only after a bound input property changes, which in our case, never gets changed and hence, this hook is never called.

Similarly, ngOnDestroy is called once the component is about to destroy.In our case, a component is never destroyed and hence, this hook never gets called.
